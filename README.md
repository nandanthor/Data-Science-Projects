A collection of some data science and machine learning projects I've done over the last few months.  All in python.

All datasets come from Kaggle.com

Some bare-bones code comes from Sentdex and PythonProgramming.net

Right now, everything is using sklearn - some deep learning in TensorFlow and Theano coming up soon.
